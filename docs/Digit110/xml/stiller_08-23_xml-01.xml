<location>On Board La Touraine</location>,

<date>June 30th, 1917</date>.

Even now that we are out of sight of <mass>land</mass>, it seems impossible that I am actually off to <country>France</country>
and, for the first time in my life, <act>traveling alone</act>. Everything has happened so quickly since the 
<org>American Fund for French Wounded</org> found an opening for me in <city>Paris</city> that I suppose I am still somewhat 
<emotion>dazed</emotion> and <emotion>bewildered</emotion>. The fact that I don't know what it will all be like and that I can't look ahead 
makes it easier to be <emotion>happy</emotion> and live in the present. Of course I have had a bit of a taste in <city>New York</city> 
of the work that the <org>A. F. F. W.</org> is doing but its Headquarters in <city>Paris</city> will be different in some ways I fancy.

I can't get over how lucky I am to have this chance for I realize how few girls of my age
are getting across, and I understood the grit and pluck which made you <act>encourage</act> me on my great 
adventure and send me along a path which has proved so dangerous of late.

As we <act>drifted</act> down the <mass>river</mass>, in the <desc>sunset glow with two absurd tugs puffing alongside</desc>, 
I know that many eyes were moist and that the same thought was in all our minds. How many 
of this <location>ship's</location> company will see that sky-line again! It was very quiet, no one spoke much, 
and, little by little, the glow faded from the sky and one <mass>star</mass> after another appeared. 
I knew that you would be looking at those same stars down in <city>Lakewood</city> and that your thoughts
and prayers were the same that filled my heart at that moment. Somehow distance does not separate, 
after all.

We waited near the <location>Statue of Liberty</location> until <time>midnight</time>—a rumor had it that a "personage" was 
to come on board. This individual was <desc>shrouded in mystery</desc> until we put to sea when it was given out 
that the party which had <act>clambered aboard</act> in the <time>night</time> was none other than the <org>Italian Mission</org>. 
Our spirits rose at once for, what with <char>Frank Sayre</char> on the <location>boat</location> and these distinguished <char>Italian gentlemen</char>, 
we shall doubtless be honored by a bigger convoy and so doubly safe. However, thus far we have but two 
destroyers <act>following</act> us. They can be seen distinctly outlined against the horizon, 
one on each side, and seem to be the same <desc>somber gray which all ships are affecting in this war</desc>. 
A <char>sailor</char> informed me this morning that we weren't in much danger for the <time>first four or five days</time> 
but that after that I might see some excitement. Here's hoping!

I have a <location>small inside cabin</location> and my <char>room-mate</char> is quite a character. She is a native of 
<country>Haiti</country>, <desc>voluble and very portly</desc>—<desc>has <obj>four large pieces of baggage</obj> in our <location><desc>tiny</desc> stateroom</location></desc>, 
<desc>wears a costume which resembles a <char>Mother Hubbard</char></desc> and <char><action>smokes</action> countless thin cigarettes that 
smell like incense</char>! When I appeared, there didn't seem to be much room for me but, as she says, 
luckily I am <desc>small</desc>, and I was soon <act>tucked into</act> the upper berth with my belongings! She really 
isn't bad and after looking me over carefully told me that she didn't think we would <act>fight</act> and 
from that time has beamed upon me! She is going over to join <char>her son</char> who has been fighting with the 
French since the beginning of the war but will never go back to the <location>Front</location> now, having lost some 
fingers off each hand. She is so <emotion>thankful</emotion>, she says, that he hasn't lost more than his fingers.
