                I'm William Stiller, though I prefer to be called Will by friends. A recent graduate from Penn State University, I hold a degree in Digital Media, Arts, and Technology (DIGIT) with a minor in Data Visualization. My academic and professional journey has equipped me with skills in database management, data visualization, programming, and statistical analysis; enabling me to form and explore innovative solutions in my approaches.

                My enthusiasm lies in constructing and delving into new technologies. Taking the time to thoroughly research, understand, and explore the potential of programs is a process that allows me to gain a deep understanding of tools. The challenge of researching and building from the ground up is one of my most effective methods to bring innovative solutions to life.

                Currently, I am on the lookout for a Ph.D. program in the field of Data Science and Information Technology, aiming to start in Fall 2023. If you have a challenge or wish to connect, feel free to reach out to me at stillewill54@gmail.com.
