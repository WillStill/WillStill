                    <p> I'm William Stiller, though I prefer to be called Will by friends. I graduated from <a href="https://behrend.psu.edu/">Penn State University, the Behrend College</a> in December 2023 with a undergraduate degree in <a href="https://bulletins.psu.edu/undergraduate/colleges/behrend/digital-media-arts-technology-ba/">Digital Media, Arts, and Technology</a> with a minor in Data Visualization. During my undergraduate studies, my major projects involved myself in text markup, natural language processing, and data visualization. My studies led me towards the research field of text analysis and data science where I hope to earn a master's degree before enrolling in a PhD program.</p>
					
					<p>Interests of mine include working with heterogeneous data from systems (originating from various formats and/or sources), retrieving information and data from collections, and obtaining key analyses of data through processing (such as NLP). Much of this is largely due to my <a href="https://www.nist.gov/surf">SURF fellowship</a> at the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/">National Institute of Standards and Technology.</a></p>
					
					<p>I’m planning to expand my knowledge and interests further in ways that will allow me to explore the extent of human-computer interaction—namely, information retrieval, QA, and summarization of systems with limited and heterogeneous/multimodal data. Additionally, I aim for my work to serve interdisciplinary applications (including the health industry and manufacturing) and to facilitate better communication between disciplines. Website development will also forever remain a favorite activity of mine.</p>
					
					<p> I'm currently enrolled at the <a href="https://www.nvcc.edu/">Northern Virginia Community College</a> where I'm taking courses in algorithms, data structures, and advanced mathmatics to better prepare myself for a master's program in Fall 2026.</p>
