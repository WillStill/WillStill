        <!-- ws: "The markup in the document following the root element must be well-formed." sourceDoc is the root element of this xml document, by having the text element outside of sourceDoc the xml document is trying to make two root elements. Either an element is placed around sourceDoc and text, or the text element goes inside of sourceDoc-->

            <p>Most of the <orgName>XML Working Groups</orgName> have been closed by now; this year saw <orgName type="workGroup">XQuery</orgName> and <orgName type="workGroup">XSLT</orgName>
                close, their work successfully completed. </p> 
                <!-- ws: unsure as to where the missing closing p element was meant to go, so I placed it after the sentence. -->
                <p>As we wind down work on standardizing the XML stack at <orgName>W3C</orgName> it’s worth looking at some of
                    what we have accomplished and why. <codeLang>W3C XML, the Extensible Markup Language</codeLang>, is one of
                    the world’s most widely-used formats for representing and exchanging information. The
                    final <codeLang type="stack">XML stack</codeLang> <!-- ws: closing codeLang had a foward slash at the end of the element name, not the beginning. --> is more powerful and easier to work with than many people know,
                        especially for people who might not have used XML since its early days.</p>
