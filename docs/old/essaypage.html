                Each method of creating a site came with its challenges. WordPress was difficult to navigate and create
                unique changes to your website allowing it to feel like your own while doing well in providing graphically
                pleasing designs. To the opposite of WordPress, GitHub allowed for greater freedom in customizing your
                website, so long as you knew how to code and had an idea for your site. The biggest issue I had with GitHub
                Pages is that I didn’t know, and still don’t know how to properly organize the lines of code or the CSS.

                I had difficulties with WordPress when trying to have the site act in a certain way. I struggled with
                making a post only visible on the home page and ended up resolving it by creating a brand-new page. This
                difference between the dashboard and the customization tab is also confusing. However, the way elements were
                displayed eventually worked and would work across devices, unlike GitHub.

                On my monitor, I was able to get my GitHub page to look how I wanted with quite a bit of work. However, the
                site hasn’t translated well to smaller screens. I likely added an element in the CSS that is hurting the
                rest of the page, but that is a problem for future William to deal with. HTML and CSS were a lot of
                troubleshooting, and while I didn’t mind it too bad, others might have found this more difficult. I had the
                most difficulty operating with the justify and align properties of CSS.

                To operate WordPress, I think a familiarity or being guided through the site would be the most beneficial to
                learning how to develop the site. I had already been introduced to WordPress through Professor Hartung at PSU
                Behrend before Digit 100 and knew of its limitations. Adobe Spark does a better job at creating a website
                with only half the functionality. PSU WordPress also is different from WordPress, meaning any materials to
                learn likely come through PSU. When using it as a blog or to post updates on a lengthy project, it is
                superior to HTML for its simplicity.

                Many sources teach how to code in HTML and CSS, and likely every problem I could ever encounter has been
                asked and solved before. As well, there are thousands of sites where you can look into the code to learn how a
                professional site might be organized. Using GitHub Pages to create a site provides so much freedom of
                expression that isn’t possible with WordPress, at the expense of learning how to code.

                I want to continue developing a site using GitHub Pages because I plan to use it as a personal site in the 
                future. Design-wise, I want to change a lot, but I would prefer to work on how to make the site accessible on 
                smaller screens.
