    <desc>These crunchy, spicy rounds with their cracked, sugary tops are equally at home dunked in tea, coffee, or milk, and frequently enjoyed during the November/December holiday season. But they're just as welcome on a mellow, golden, late-September afternoon, with a comfortable lounge chair and a large glass of fresh-squeezed lemonade.
