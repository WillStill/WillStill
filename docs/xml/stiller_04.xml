            <verse>Got something to eat.</verse>
            <verse>Thus at Tuskegee</verse>
            <verse>He built a school</verse>
            <verse>With book-learning there</verse>

            <verse ref="2">Was not today.</verse>
            <verse>Sometimes he had</verse>
            <verse>Compromise in his talk—</verse>
            <verse>For a man must crawl</verse>
            <verse>Before he can walk—</verse>
            <verse ref="2">And in Alabama in '85</verse>
            <verse ref="2">A joker was lucky</verse>
            <verse ref="2">To be alive.</verse>
            <verse>But Booker T.</verse>
            <verse>Was nobody's fool:</verse>
            <verse>You may carve a dream</verse>
            <verse>With an humble tool.</verse>
            <verse>The tallest tower</verse>
            <verse>Can tumble down</verse>
            <verse>If it be not rooted</verse>
            <verse>In solid ground.</verse>
            <verse>So, being a far-seeing</verse>

        - <note>Langston Hughes (1902-1967), known for his lyric poetry,
            often wrote insightful commentaries about African-American culture and race relations in
            the United States. In this 1941 poem he makes a case for the vindication of educator
            Booker T. Washington (1856-1915), the former slave and founder of Tuskegee Institute
            (1881) and the National Negro Business League (1900) who was harshly criticized by many
            people for emphasizing vocational education as the prerequisite for the political
            empowerment of black people. In his poem, Hughes stresses the fact that Washington
            wanted to train the head, the heart, and the hand. He focuses on Washington's
            practicality and explains the educator's strategy with the statement, "Sometimes he had
            / compromise in his talk-- / for a man must crawl / before he can walk / and in Alabama
            in '85 / a joker was lucky / to be alive."</note> 
        - <note>Because the Library holds
            several dated drafts of the "Ballad of Booker T.," as well as the signed, finished
            version, researchers can learn how Hughes crafted his words so that the rhythm and the
            rhyme were syncopated, smooth, and flowing.</note>
