        ws: NOTES:
            <element xml:id="one two three"></element> works well, but I want to draw focus to the 'xml:id' part. Does 'xml:' ensure that it is referencing the xml document and not the next file over? Or is it just a name that can change, and we stick with it to aid us if we manipulate the text (or reference it outside the doc)?
            I tried using xml:idrefs="l-5 l-6 l-7 l-8 l-9 l-10" at first. Would xml:idrefs be better to use in the situation with the stamp? I wasnt given an error so I thought that the attribute's name (xml:id="") was better used for consistency.
            
            
===============================        
        ebb: SUGGESTIONS: Try standoff markup, maybe like this:
            Here we are setting up unique identifiers for each note using the standard @xml:id attribute. The value of an @xml:id must only be 
            used once in the entire document, just like an HTML @id attribute. However, any attributes (like @ref) that *point to* the @xml:id would take a
            hashmark `#` at the start of the value to **point to** the unique id. You may have as many hashtagged references to the unique id as you wish. 
            
            NOTE: There's a standing rule, or really a datatype form, that unique IDs in XML and HTML MUST be a combination of letters and numbers. They may NOT be only numbers. 
            They CAN be only letters.

                 <note xml:id="n1"> These lines come from Booker T. Washington's 1895 speech from the Cotton States and International Exposition in Atlanta, Georgia.</note>

            ebb: ALSO, try handling the red Library of Congress stamp in a standoff way, but still SEPARATE from your own editorial commentary.
            Figure out an XML markup strategy for this. 
=================================================== 
           WS: 
            This is a very inefficient way of tracking down references to other literary works within a text. Any ideas about how to better do this are appriciated!
