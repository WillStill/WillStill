            July 26th letter
            
            <span class="lime"> July 26, 1955</span>
            <span class="aqua">Brussels</span>
            
            
            Dear People:
            We are just about to take off for <span class="aqua">Copenhagen</span> and are sit- ting
            around so I will try to send this second installment of our trip report. If I
            remember correctly, the last letter came from the boat. We arrived in
            <span class="aqua">Cherbourg</span> and got safely on the <span class="aqua">train</span> to
            fin that it was over 90. We nearly died on the ride to <span class="aqua">Paris</span>. Very
            unairconditioned train and blazing sun. The first thing we did when we arrived at
            <span class="aqua">Le Bristol</span> was fall in cold tub. We went out for
            dinner later and cele- brater with <span class="persName">Charles
               Jubilee</span>. Very tasty! The next day Mrs. Behrend hired a
            <span class="aqua">car</span> and guide and we drove all over <span class="aqua">Paris</span>.
            It is so beautiful but so expensive<span class="x">!</span>
            $90 a minute to breath! We did a bit of shopping, had lunch in the
            <span class="aqua">Bois de Boulougne</span> shopped on the Left Bank, got
            <span class="aqua">train</span> tickets and that night went to the <span class="aqua">Casino de
               Paris</span>. Pretty naked ladies I must say. We were not carried away by it
            but did see it, so that is that.
            The next morning we were up at the crack of dawn and off to Tours. The man and
            his wife who ran the <span class="aqua">Manior Berheron</span>, where we stayed as a
            m<span class="x"></span>mber of the family were terribly nice. We
            arravied in time for lunch and then got in a little car and went
            through some beautiful country to see some of the chateaux. We enjoyed it
            traemndously. You can see where the old French painters get all their inspirations.
            Lovely rivers, old mills and beautiful trees. That night after dinner we
            went to a nearby chateau, <span class="aqua">Azay-le-Rideau</span> which was illuminated. Just like fairyland.
            They also had a sort of play very cleverly done just done with voices and lighting
            which told the history of the building. We will never forget it.
            Thursday, the Davidsons, our hosts and their little boy and and
            ourselves went on another chateaux trip which was just a grand as the day before.
            We
            had a picnic on the way and <span class="x"><span class="hand">tea</span></span> on the way home. Great
            fun. The only thing that marred the trip was another guest who arrived who knew all
            about everything and told it in the loudest of voices. I got in a ter- rible row
            with him about sports. Everyone was on my side but you couldn't get a word in edge
            wise. Itwas rather funny to look back on but I nearly had a nervous breakdown when
            it was going on.
            
            
            Friday we left Tours at about eleven and got back in Paris for
            lunch. After the lovely meal we changed out on foot to do some
            shopping.

            and walked around. This we dis. Not too many purchases. We were going upto
            <span class="aqua">montmartre</span> but decided to get to bed early to leave for
            <span class="aqua">Brussels</span> the next day.
            We had a perfect flight from <span class="aqua">London</span> here. Mercedes Bucher met us
            at the airport and we came to the hotel. the Wilsons, Mrs. BBs cousin, called and
            came over for a drink. We then went for a delicious lunch, food is
            marvelous here, on the <span class="aqua">Grand Place</span> which is fantatic. Mercedes has a
            <span class="aqua">car</span> so we spent the afternoon seeing
            <span class="aqua">Brussels</span> which is very pretty. Lovely park and old buildings. Had
            dinner in a very old place with lots of atmoshpere and good food.
            Sunday we piled into the <span class="aqua">car</span> and went to
            <span class="aqua">Burges</span>, about and hour and a half away. A divine old town. We
            took a ride in a <span class="aqua">carriage</span> all over the town. Great fun. On
            the way back we stopped for tea in the <span class="aqua">Osten</span> which is
            a big seaside resort. Arrived back here at eight and ha a light supper
            on the <span class="aqua">Grand Place</span> which is illuminated at night and breathtaking.
            Yesterday we shopped most of the day and walked around seeing things. All had
            cocktails at the <span class="aqua">Wilsons hotel</span> and dinner
            later.
             It is now Tuesday again and we leave here at 12:55 for
            <span class="aqua">Copen- hagen</span> arriving there at <span class="lime">4:30</span>. Have to change
            planes in <span class="aqua">Amsterdam</span>. Mer- bill etc. The <span class="persName">Wilsons</span> left
            a while ago for <span class="aqua">Paris</span>. We will see them in <span class="aqua">London</span> in
            August.
            We see by the paper that it is still unberable in <span class="aqua">New York</span> and
            are pleased to be here. weather has been perfect except for the day we arrived.
            
            
            Much love to all from both of us.

            they are never underfoot. If you should want a place where you can safetly leave yours
            while touring <span class="aqua">Europe, Bécheron</span> is 
            the place you are looking for. Our children were born in the <span class="aqua">United States</span> and speak French and English as of course we do.
            A week in <span class="aqua">Bécheron</span> is over before you realize it! You won't want to miss the thrilling sight of the
            illuminated chateaux;
            they alone are worth the trip. The <span class="aqua">"Sleeping Beauty" castle of Usse</span>, <span class="aqua">Azay-le-Rideau</span>, famous Chenonceau and Chambord are but 
            a few of the fabulous palaces which surround us.
            During one of your outings we will picnic in the <span class="aqua">Forêt de Loches</span> near a circular 12th Century chapel, or on the banks of the
            Loire across from <span class="aqua">Mme. de Pompadour's palace at Ménars</span>. We will also take you to one of the outstanding restaurants of Tours 
            on a picturesque medieval square.
            We are looking forward with pleasure to meeting you, with or without your children.
            We'll be glad to answer any specific questions
            you may have.

               We got on board about <span class="lime">10</span>
            <span class="persName">Harriet</span> had stayed in <span class="aqua">Greenwich</span> over night so went in town with us. <span class="x">Wm</span> drove the <span class="aqua">station wagon</span> with our 
            bags. Very cleverlym selected as we had two s<span class="x">uu</span>t cases each and a "bottle bag and the typewriter-plus
            a very unhealthy looking green duffle bag(reserved for purchases. THIS folded up on
            thebbottem of a suit case for future use!
            State room gay with flowers and champagne. We had a send of party. <span class="persName">Billy</span> was hiding behind a curtain and was a HUGE
            surprise'<span class="persName">Caryl</span> had arranged it this way <span class="persName">Gail's</span> mother and a friend- <span class="persName">Dale</span> and <span class="persName">Kissy</span> got to the <span class="aqua">dock</span> just after <span class="lime">10.30 </span>
            and were not allowed to come on board. Too bad.
            <span class="aqua">Huge ship</span>. Like a section of the <span class="aqua">Waldorf- the Reacock Alley</span> plus several of the <span class="aqua">dining</span> rooms- afloat Streams of 
            PEOPLE nulling about.
            
            We had a table in the <span class="aqua">dining</span> room with 5 other femal ladies. Thought it would divert us. The one man looked us
            over and
            next meal he wasn't there. So we <span class="x">dr4ew</span> <span class="x">ano</span> anoother lady. It all proved to be amusing. We exchange addresses and werephotographed
            to-gether. 
            Voyage very smooth all way over. We took in the <span class="aqua">movies</span> and <span class="aqua">pools</span>. I won a few dollars on a pool.
            A <span class="persName">Mr and Mrs Andeson</span>, very nice friends of <span class="persName">H.</span> and <span class="persName">Caryls</span> asked us for cocktails one evening. Then there
            were the parties of the Captain and the Purser Also <span class="persName">Esther Boyer</span> was on board with a party of eight in cabin class, she 
            was to steer (ab??) over <span class="aqua">Europe</span>. She came up and has tea with us one day.
            The <span class="persName">Captain</span> and <span class="persName">Purser</span> both were on the <span class="aqua">Franconia</span> about years ago- as under officers- on a world cruise wer were on.
            Both exptremely cordial. 
            Took <span class="aqua">train</span> around <span class="lime">noon</span> for <span class="aqua">Paris</span>. Hot as blazes. and stuffy besides. Had lunch en route. Quite good.
            <span class="aqua">Paris</span> and piled our belongings intoo a <span class="aqua">cab</span> and landed at <span class="aqua">Le Br istol</span>- a rather smallish hotel were diplomats go- white marble 
            and mirrors. We had an oval white panelled round sitting room. (which we didn't need
            and later gave up.)
            Very weary and after some refreshing tub baths went over to the <span class="aqua">Crenailliere</span>(nearby) where we had a very delicious dinner.
